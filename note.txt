III/ Connect to mongodb 
    1) old connection way
    when we require a module in java or php (oop), it will run the source code
    2) new connection way
    3) way to test how many connection
    4) notify when server is connection overloading
    5) should we disConnect() continuously
    no need , because mongoose use a pool to manage database, automatically open and close connection when need
    6) what is poolSize? why it important?
    poolSize is a group of connection to database that we can reuse. If poolSize = 50 , mongo will check in whether poolSize has any connection, 
    if yes , it will use the connection for a new request, otherwise mongoose will create a new connection
    7) Connections > poolSizes 
    If connections > poolSizes, mongoose will put these connection into a queue to wait the before connections
